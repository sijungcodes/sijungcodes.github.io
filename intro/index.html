<p>#My name is Sijung.
I am a Full Stack Developer living in Nagano, Japan.</p>
<p>###Hello! I am Sijung. Before residing amongst the breathtaking nature of Nagano, I lived across Asia, Europe, and North America. Here is how my journey to Nagano began...</p>
<p>###It started with mecha-robots and console games. Like many of my generation, Japanese animation and console games played a big part in my childhood, especially during my middle school years in Taiwan. Later in life, I visited Japan many times and was captivated by her awesome nature. Eventually, I even fell in love with a lady from Nagano and we got married. After many years of living in cites around the world, we decided to settle in Nagano and raise our daughter away from the hustle and bustle of city life.</p>
<p>###The photo of me and the snow monkeys was shot by a kind guest. I am very thankful to these snow monkeys. If not for them I would not have such a cool job that allows me run around in the snow, befriend guests from all over the world, and last but not least, stay fit! In summer, I also help local farmers in the vineyards and orchards. During my free time, I enjoy cycling across Naganoâ€™s gorgeous mountain ranges.</p>
<p>Hope to see you on my tour!</p>
